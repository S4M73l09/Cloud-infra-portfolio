# **S4M73l09 Infra Portfolio**  
 
Hi, I'm Samuel. **DevOps** on Azure: I automate infrastructure with Terraform + Ansible and deployments with CI/CD, leaving everything observable with Prometheus/Grafana.
I learned by riding and breaking into real labs and projects; Today I work to make environments reproducible, safe and documented.

Technical portfolio as a freelance **DevOps** specialist in infrastructure automation using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **CI/CD**, **Docker** and deployments on **Cloud**.

# What projects have I done?

## 🖥️ Project: Automated Jellyfin Server

**Challenge:** Build a fully automated and reproducible multimedia server on Azure.  
**Solution:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, provisioning via Ansible, and GitHub Actions pipelines handling secret rotation and automated playbook execution.  
**Impact:** Full deployment in under 10 minutes with reduced human errors.  
**Stack:** Terraform · Ansible · Azure · Docker · GitHub Actions · CI/CD  
**Code:** [Repository](https://github.com/S4M73l09/ProyectoServer)

# Infrastructure Lab.

## Bootstrap/Infra-Live in GCS

### 🅱️ Proyecto: Bootstrap en GCS.

**Challenge:** Create a sufficient template for the correct and functional deployment of separate infrastructures so as not to inherit faults.  
**Solution:** Create a Bootstrap with everything needed and separate it for use in future projects or deployments without fear of failure since they are separate.  
**Impact:** Bootstrap separated from the actual infrastructure and configured to improve deployment.  
**Stack:** OIDC · GCloud · Terraform · Github Actions  
**Code:** [Repository](https://github.com/S4M73l09/GCS-Bootstrap---Live)  

### ℹ️ Proyecto: Infra-Live en GCS

**Challenge:** Create relevant infrastructure using Bootstrap.  
**Solution:** Infrastructure using the Bootstrap intermediary.  
**Impact:** It simplifies the creation, administration, and improvement of infrastructure by separating all the real infrastructure from Bootstrap into different repositories.  
**Stack:** Terraform · GCS · Docker · Ansible · Monitoring  
**Code:** [Repository](https://github.com/S4M73l09/GCS-Infra-Live)  


### 📈 Global Impact (All Projects)

| KPI | Before | After | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Deployment time | ~45 min | ~10–12 min | Automatic change application with CI/CD |
| Manual intervention | High | Minimal | Full automation with Ansible and Terraform |
| Infrastructure cost | High (unoptimized) | ~25–30% lower | Optimized resources across Azure and GCP |
| Operational maintenance | Complex, manual | Simplified | More agile and easier-to-maintain environments |
